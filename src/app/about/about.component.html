            Tyler, the founder and soul of Garden, has been passionate about plants since he was 7 years old. He
            began gardening
            with his grandparents, starting with tomatoes and eventually moving to squash and pumpkin gardening.
            After a
            personal spiritual journey, Tyler became a survivalist that can live solely off plants and berries.

            Garden is a passion project Tyler has started with encouragement from his shaman. With every 1000th
            tree
            sold, Tyler
            will include a lock of his dreads in a vacuum-sealed package. If you would like to get in contact with
            Tyler, for
